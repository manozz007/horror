<p data-adtags-visited="true">Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the study of computer science focusing on developing software or machines that exhibit human intelligence.</p>
<div></div>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">A lot of people think that AI is just a sci-fi concept that’s being used in movies like Star Wars, Terminator or Lucy, but there is a lot more to it. AI is a very broad topic ranging from a simple calculator to self-drive technology to something that might change the future.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>Primary Goals and Applications of AI</b><br>
The primary goals of AI include deduction and reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, natural language processing (NLP), learning, perception and the ability to manipulate and move objects. Long-term goals of AI research includes achieving Creativity, Social Intelligence, and General (Human Level) Intelligence.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">AI has heavily influenced different sectors, that we may not recognize. Ray Kurzweil says “Many thousands of AI applications are deeply embedded in the infrastructure of every industry”. John McCarthy, one of the founders of AI, once said that “as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.”</p>
<p class="inline-ad-slot" id="inline-ad-1" style="float:left;height:0px;margin:0 auto;overflow:hidden;width:685px;" data-adtags-width="685" data-adtags-visited="true"></p><p data-adtags-visited="true">While, there are various different forms of AI as it’s a broad concept, we can divide it into the following three categories based on AI’s capabilities –</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>Weak AI</b> – Also referred as Narrow AI, a weak AI focuses on one narrow task. There is no self-awareness, genuine intelligence in case of a weak AI.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Siri is a good example of a weak AI combining several weak AI techniques to function. It can do a lot of things for the user, but fails when asked question outside the limits of application.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>Strong AI</b> – Also &nbsp;referred as General AI, or Human-Level AI, it’s a computer that is as smart as a human brain. This sort of AI will be able to perform all tasks that a human could do. There is a lot of research going in this field, but we still have to conquer it.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>Artificial Super intelligence</b> – Nick Bostrom, leading AI thinker, defines it as “an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.”</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Artificial Super intelligence is the reason for why many prominent scientists and technologists including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have raised concerns regarding the possibility of human extinction.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>How to Get Started?</b><br>
The first thing that you need to do is learn a programming language. Though there are a lot of languages that you can start with, Python is the preferred choice of many to start with because of libraries better suited for Machine Learning.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Here are some good resources for Python –<br>

A BOT is the most basic example of a weak AI that can do automated tasks on your behalf. Chat bots were one of the first automated programs to be called as ‘bots’.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Web crawlers used by Search Engines like Google are a perfect example of sophisticated and advanced BOT.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">You are advised to learn the following before you start programming bot in order to make your lives easier –</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">xpath – This will help you to inspect and target HTML and build your bot from what you see there. You can learn more about xpath here –<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xpath_syntax.asp"><span style="color:#065e00;">http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_syntax.asp</span></a></p>
<div></div>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">regex – regex will help you to process the data you feed your bot by cleaning up or targeting (or both) the parts that matter to your logic. You can learn and practice regex here – <a href="http://regexr.com/"><span style="color:#065e00;">http://regexr.com/</span></a></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">REST – This is really important as you will eventually work with APIs. You can use requests to do this for its simplicity.

<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>What now?</b><br>
Once you have a thorough understanding of your preferred programming language and enough practice with the basics, you should start to learn more about Machine Learning. In Python start learning Scikit-learn, NLTK, SciPy, PyBrain, and numpy libraries which will be useful while coding Machine Learning algorithms.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">It is also very important to familiarize yourself with Advanced Math and Stats as it will help you a lot in writing ML algorithms.</p>

<p data-adtags-visited="true">We all know that the Facebook studies and monitors the activities of its users for various purposes using their own Artificial Intelligence mechanism. This data helps the social network in showing the relevant information on the user’s News Feed, which is usually evaluated by analysing your social media interests and other activities on the website.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">But, now you have an open source and&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/d4t4x/"><span style="color:#176600;">free tool</span></a> with using which you can easily keep a track on what kind of monitoring mechanism Facebook has implemented and what kind of your activities does the social network tracks. This tool which is a Chrome extension is called <a href="http://dataselfie.it/#/"><span style="color:#176600;">Data Selfie</span></a>. This tool utilises machine learning algorithms to inspect what is read about your personality by the way you use Facebook. It also identifies your social media patterns and offers an opportunity to ensure totally customised and personalised experience.</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">&nbsp;</p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Through the Data Selfie, you can monitor the way these machine learning algorithms monitor and process all your activities on the Facebook and how they get&nbsp;information about your personality, interests, and habits. This is made possible through the world famous cognitive system from IBM, called the mighty “Watson.” When you <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/data-selfie/kjmnobfdkgaclpkgeniccafoennghjnm"><span style="color:#176600;">download the app</span></a>, it starts tracking your interactions on Facebook. It&nbsp;checks your every single your Like, post, the amount of time you spent checking out a shared article/post and every little thing such as when you scrolled and for how long. All the information is logged into the app.</p>

<p>Watching stories set in scary haunted houses, the eerie sounds that turn our palms sweaty and tense up our muscles, isn’t it fun?&nbsp;The best part of horror movies is that we know what’s coming, we know how things are going to play out, who’s going to live, who’s going to die, we even like the bad guys more than the good ones.</p>
<h3><em>So let’s take a look at the&nbsp;15 Horror Movies That You Must See Before Dying!</em></h3>
<h3>1. Halloween (1978)</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-110384" src="./1_files/halloween-1982-1-600x355.jpg" alt="halloween-1982-1" width="600" height="355"></p>
<p><a class="imageSourceAnchor" href="http://wheresthejump.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/halloween-1982-1.jpg"><em>Source</em></a></p>
<p>This film is considered to be one of the greatest horror movies of all time. It’s full of suspense, it’s scary, and it’s thrilling. The film is credited with reinventing the slasher genre, the&nbsp;Golden Age of Slasher film&nbsp;which ran from 1978 to 1984. Halloween is considered to have started that golden age.&nbsp;It’s the story of Michael Myers, on Halloween night of 1963, six-year-old Michael Myers stabbed his sister to death. 15 years later Michael escapes from a psychiatric hospital, comes back to kill.</p>
<h3>2. A Nightmare On Elm Street (1983)</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-110383" src="./1_files/1984-A-Nightmare-On-Elm-Street-013-600x338.jpg" alt="horror" width="600" height="338"></p>

<p>You can’t run and you can’t hide. The story of the movie in a nutshell. A Nightmare of Elm Street is about several teenagers who are stalked and killed in their dreams by Freddy Krueger. &nbsp;Freddy Kruger is&nbsp;a cruel serial killer who kills his victims in their dreams. Dying in dreams result in actual death. This is a movie where the bad guy is much cooler than the heroes. Because Freddy Krueger is an interesting and one of a kind character. He’s the ghost of a child killer, he’s a&nbsp;wise-cracking murderer with a metal claw hand.</p>
<h3>3. Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-110386" src="./1_files/TexasFeatu-1-1-600x330.jpg" alt="TexasFeatu-1" width="600" height="330"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This film is considered to be the origin of the slasher genre. &nbsp;The film made the use&nbsp;power tools as murder weapons popular and the characterization of the killer as a large, hulking, faceless figure in slasher films originated from this film. It introduced&nbsp;the iconic character of Leatherface. It tells the story about a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibalistic psychopaths while on their way to visit their friend’s grandfather grave in Texas. This film is considered to be the origin of the slasher genre.</p>
<h3>4. The Exorcist (1973)</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-110385" src="./1_files/scariest-movie-title-1-600x335.jpg" alt="scariest-movie-title" width="600" height="335"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Considered as one of the greatest&nbsp;Hitchcock films. If you see haven’t seen this movie then don’t call yourself a horror fan. Earlier horror films were only about&nbsp;monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. But this movie changed it all, it started the genre of psychological thriller horror. Still today the&nbsp;Marion Crane’s shower scene or the freaky look on Norman Bates’ face will send chills down your spine. Watch the film to experience the genius of Hitchcock.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the people would say Jaws is a thriller, not a horror film, then why have you included it on the list. Well anyone who thinks that doesn’t have a proper understanding of horror films. Jaws is a&nbsp;quintessential horror film. It’s about a&nbsp;gigantic great white shark starts terrorizing a small island community. To stop the man-eating shark,&nbsp;a police chief, a marine scientist and a fisherman&nbsp;join forces.</p>

<div class="jetpack-video-wrapper"><span class="embed-youtube" style="text-align:center; display: block;"><iframe class="youtube-player" src="./1_files/2QDKYvl82FY.html" allowfullscreen="true" style="border: 0px; display: block; margin: 0px; width: 685px; height: 386px;" data-ratio="0.5635036496350365" data-width="685" data-height="386"></iframe></span></div>
<p data-adtags-visited="true"><b><span style="font-size:large;">About Bermuda Triangle&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Bermuda Triangle is a strange triangular area on the Atlantic ocean where many ships sailing through it or planes flying over it have apparently disappeared without a trace. In few of such cases where wrecks could be found, the crew had vanished. And such incidents have been happening since centuries. More than 1,000 ships and planes have disappeared in the triangle area over the past five centuries.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So getting excited already? Well, the facts however are quite far from what is generally known or believed to be true. Many stories and myths have been created by writers through sheer imagination which they used rampantly to draw publicity to their books. In many cases, the facts got blurred. Many theories, controversies and counter arguments have come up over the years challenging the mysteries that created fear psychosis among people since ages.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So what is the fact? Is it at all true? Partially true? Or all nonsense? Let’s dig deeper to understand that while keeping in mind that far too many incidents have taken place in this area for it to be ignored.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b><span style="font-size:large;">How did it all start?&nbsp;</span></b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">It all started by authors who were novel writers, and the mystery was initially perpetuated by them. But don’t jump into a conclusion yet. While we all know that novel writers are good in wild imaginations, but many of these writers were actually popular and well respected authors of their times.<p></p>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The abnormalities on the sea was first noted in 1950 by Edward Jones in the daily newspaper Miami Herald published in Florida. However the mystery started catching wide-scale attention in 1952 when George Sand wrote in Fate magazine about incidents like Flight-19, a training flight of five torpedo bomber planes, all of which went missing during a routine training session in 1945 and never returned.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Subsequently several authors wrote about various other mysterious incidents in the triangle area. While some of such reports were dubious or without much substance, several incidents had actually occurred and remained unexplained. The words around the mystery started spreading fast, and soon Bermuda Triangle was a reality, at least in the minds of millions all over the world.</div>
</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b><span style="font-size:large;">Where is Bermuda Triangle?&nbsp;</span></b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">By the simplest of all definitions, Bermuda Triangle is located off the South-Eastern coast of the United States and in the Atlantic Ocean. The three corners of the triangle are: Miami (in Florida); San Juan (in Puerto Rico); and Bermuda (a north-Atlantic island). The American author Vincent Gaddis was the first to define this boundary in 1964 in an issue of the magazine named Argosy and called the area ‘The Deadly Bermuda Triangle’.<p></p>
<div class="s2" align="justify">However over the years, several other authors kept extending the area beyond its original boundary because they seemed to identify mysterious incidents in nearby areas as well. how it is actually laid out on the Atlantic, understand if it actually has a map to identify the location (i.e. latitude / longitude), and whether you will ever know when you are entering the dreaded area as you take a cruise or flight.</div>
</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b><span style="font-size:large;">Disappearances&nbsp;</span></b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Below are some amazing stories of planes and ships that disappeared or met with ill fate while crossing the triangle area. As you visit the links, you will also see my findings behind such great mysteries of all times. In most cases I have discussed and explained the possible causes, in some cases I have also given excerpts from official reports that were produced by US Navy, US Air Force or US Coast Guards after completing the search operations. And in several cases, I have given updates on further findings.</div>

<div class="s2" align="justify">So what caused the ships and aircraft to disappear mysteriously? There have been many research and explorations done to uncover the mystery. There is no single theory that can explain all the incidents of disappearances. The ships and aircraft could have been victims of different circumstances, and things would have happened quickly and unexpectedly. While many theories have come up from researchers and scientists trying to explain the various incidents, here are few of the most popular ones:</div>
<ul>
<li class="s2"><b><span style="color:#008080;">Hexagonal Cloud &amp;&nbsp;Air Bombs&nbsp;</span></b></li>
</ul>
<div class="s2" align="justify">From satellite images Meteorologists have recently discovered strange hexagonal clouds that are capable of blasting winds to the ocean below at huge speeds. And such wind storms on the ocean can create waves as high as 45-feet. Planes and ships under such cloud can sink in no time.</div>
<ul>
<li class="s2"><b><span style="color:#008080;">Methane Gas&nbsp;</span></b></li>
</ul>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The gas trapped under sea floor can erupt, and as a result can lower the water density and cause ships to sink like a rock. Even planes flying over it, can catch fire and get completely destroyed during such gas blowout.</div>
<ul>
<li class="s2"><b><span style="color:#008080;">Sargasso Sea&nbsp;</span></b></li>
</ul>
<div class="s2" align="justify">It’s a strange ocean area that has no shores and bounded only by water currents on all sides. Many ships passing through it have been stranded and made motionless. Many were found derelict and without a soul.</div>
<ul>
<li class="s2"><b><span style="color:#008080;">Electronic Fog&nbsp;</span></b></li>
</ul>
<div class="s2" align="justify">A strange thick cloud appears from nowhere and engulfs a ship or a plane. Instruments begin to malfunction, and finally the ship or the aircraft vanishes without a trace.</div>
<ul>
<li class="s2"><b><span style="color:#008080;">All Major Theories&nbsp;</span></b></li>
</ul>
<div class="s2" align="justify">There are many other theories that try to solve or explain the mysteries of Bermuda Triangle and try to identify factors causing such incidents.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<p class="inline-ad-slot" id="inline-ad-7" style="float:left;height:0px;margin:0 auto;overflow:hidden;width:685px;" data-adtags-width="685" data-adtags-visited="true"></p><p data-adtags-visited="true"><b>Conclusion – The Facts &amp;&nbsp;Myths&nbsp;</b></p>
<p data-adtags-visited="true">Since a magazine first coined the phrase ‘Bermuda Triangle’ in early 1950s, the mystery has continued to attract attention. When repeated mysterious incidents of such large scale take place in the same area, it’s understandable that it would spread like fire, draw large interests among people at all levels including scientists, critics and general people, and take a mammoth shape over time.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Indeed Bermuda Triangle has become a living legend. But what is the real truth behind all this?</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">First, there is no denying that many of the incidents reported on Bermuda Triangle have actually taken place. Because a plane or ship not returning or reaching its destination is clearly recorded with official agencies concerned including US Navy, US Coast Guard etc.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">And there have been hundreds of such incidents. In few cases oil leakage, floats or wrecks could be found while in others, there were no trace of anything…. this is a fact.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So the question is not about whether the incidents took place at all or not. It’s about how they took place. This is where explanations start getting blurred, as sometimes facts get mixed up with speculations, even with imaginations.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Few more questions also spring up. Are there any other ocean areas on earth where similar such incidents take place? Are the numbers of such incidents similar or even greater than Bermuda Triangle? So if the numbers are similar or more, are such incidents actually normal on ocean routes?</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Let’s explore this, because this can throw some lights on whether we are believing something imaginary or real.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Larry Kusche, a librarian in Arizona State University was a big critic of Bermuda Triangle and made a deep research into the incidents and finally published his book ‘The Bermuda Triangle Mystery: Solved’ in 1975. Most of his research was based on referring newspapers of the times that reported the incidents, checking out the meteorological (weather) reports of the days the incidents took place.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">He concluded that the total number of such incidents in the triangle area is nothing unusual in a place where tropical cyclones or hurricanes are quite common. His study also showed that number of incidents in Bermuda Triangle is not significantly more compared to several other ocean areas.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Kusche further clarified that several authors wrongly reported several incidents. He pointed out a case where an author misreported a ship disappearing three days after it left a port in Atlantic while the fact was the ship actually left a port of the same name from Pacific ocean which was over 3,000 miles away.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">In another case Kusche showed that an author described a ship getting lost in calm sea while the meteorological report showed a strong cyclone was passing by.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Now read this… Lloyd’s is a London based insurance body and active in marine insurance market since long. They insure ships on voyage. When Lloyd’s was asked by a UK television channel if they noted unusual number of ships sinking or getting lost in Bermuda Triangle, they answered ‘NO’.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">They further confirmed that they do not even charge higher insurance rates for ships passing through Bermuda Triangle area because they consider it safe.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The US Coast Guard also supported Lloyd’s observation that the number of reported missing cases in Bermuda Triangle is nothing unusual.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Here is one more… A study conducted in 2013 for WWF (World Wide Fund for Nature) reported the 10 most accident prone ocean areas in the world for shipping. And that does not include Bermuda Triangle. In fact based on accidents recorded, the most dangerous water areas are South China Sea, the Mediterranean and the North Sea.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Now the food for thought…</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So does it all mean the notion of Bermuda Triangle being dreaded is baseless? Is it all hunky-dory out there?</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Well, there are several questions which still need to be answered before we can come to that conclusion, if at all. Hundreds of ships and planes were actually lost in that area, and many such cases are not yet explained with evidence. It is a fact that authors fanned the fire to take commercial advantage of the situation. But it is hard to believe that a legend of such gigantic nature is just a baseless myth that continues to engulf the world for so many decades. Despite thorough and sustained investigations, numerous incidents continue to baffle the investigators.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Scientists have found some interesting formations on the seafloor within the Bermuda Triangle boundaries. The ocean floor at some places suddenly drop to huge depths. In fact, some locations within the triangle have deepest trenches in the whole of Atlantic. And within this area many vessels were seemingly lost.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">It is well known that marine and airway channels across Bermuda Triangle are some of the busiest and most commercially used routes in the world. They are used extensively by numerous cruise lines and airlines connecting The USA, Europe, Caribbean islands, Bermuda, South America and even Africa.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Think of what may happen to billions of dollars of thriving international business and its impact on economy if the area gets to be known as dreaded? Will anybody want such flourishing economy to get jeopardized by officially calling out the area as dangerous?</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Many conflicting possibilities exist to keep the Bermuda Triangle mystery alive for decades to come.</div>

		<p data-adtags-visited="true">On December 4, 1872 Mary Celeste, also known as the Ghost Ship, was found without a single soul on board while she was still sailing. She was located off the coast of Portugal heading towards the Strait of Gibraltar. This happened even though the weather was fine and she had experienced and able crew. Here is the full story:</p>

<div class="s2" align="justify">The Mary Celeste was Originally named “The Amazon”, when it was built at the shipyards in Spencer Island in Nova Scotia, Canada in 1861. It was launched in the same year which also happened to be the year when the American Civil War broke out. The brigantine Mary Celeste was 31 meters long, 7.6 meters wide and displaced 282 tons of water. However since her launch, she had always been influenced under some evil power.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">During her first decade of operations, she was involved in several misadventures and passed through many changes of ownership. It was as if the ship was under the influence of a bad evil. Look at the following chronological events:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">1) The First master <i>Robert McLellan</i> fell ill and died.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">2) On her maiden voyage commanded by John Parker, the ship suffered a big damage in her hull after running into a fishing dam off the sea. Mary Celeste required major repairs at the shipyards. Later, a fire broke out at the shipyards, terminating Parker’s command.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">3) During her first Atlantic crossing, she collided in the straits of Dover with a two-masted ship which sank. Mary Celeste again required repairs.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">4) Upon her return to America she ran aground off Cow Bay, Nova Scotia.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">5) After she was pulled out of the rocks, she continued to change hands between a number of owners. No one made any profit. In fact, some of them went bankrupt.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">6) Finally she was purchased by an American, James Winchester. James bought her at a New York salvage auction for $3,000. She went through extensive repairs and renovation. When she was back again, the ship looked completely different and hardly had any resemblance with ‘The Amazon’. Her name was then changed to <i>Mary Celeste</i>.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">In October 1872, Mary Celeste was made ready on a birth in New York’s East River for a voyage to Genoa, Italy. The captain of the ship was Benjamin Briggs aged 37. Briggs’ 30-year old wife Sarah and 2-year-old child were also in the ship. And there were 7 crew making it a total of 10 on board. Captain Briggs was a very experienced and able seaman and captained five ships in his career. He himself was an owner of many ships and had spent most of his life on the sea.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Mary Celeste departed New York City on November 7, 1872. She was carrying a cargo of 1701 barrels of raw commercial alcohol valued at some $35,000 and had full insurance. Strangely after almost a month of her sail, on December 4, 1872 a British Empire vessel named <i>Dei Gratia</i> found the Mary Celeste off the coast of Portugal. She apparently looked abandoned although still under sail. There was not a single soul on board.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So what could have been the cause of such mysterious abandonment? The weather was fine and she had 6 months of food and water. The crew were all very able seamen and trustworthy. Even the personal belongings including valuables were untouched.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Here are some speculations and theories behind the mystery of Mary Celeste:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Piracy&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Some speculated that the Mary Celeste had fallen pray to the North African pirates who were known to be operating in that area. The pirates would have killed all on board and threw the bodies over to the sea.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">However, there was no such incidence of piracy reported in the Straits of Gibraltar for the last one decade. This is possibly because the British Navy were stationed there. Even if there was piracy, it is almost impossible to believe that the pirates would spare all personal and valuable possessions of the crew members. They did not even touch the cargo. Also there was no sign of violence on the ship.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>The Dei Gratia crew as suspects&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Another theory was that the crew of the ship <i>Dei Gratia</i> that salvaged the abandoned Mary Celeste, would have murdered all on board and then fabricated the story of Ghost Ship in order to claim the salvage rights. But this seems very unlikely. There was no sign of any struggle on Mary Celeste. Secondly, <i>Dei Gratia</i> departed one week after Mary Celeste did and could not have caught up with it. Also Morehouse, the captain of <i>Dei Gratia</i> was a good friend of Briggs.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Insurance Scam&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Some thought that the whole incidence was probably to make a fake insurance claim. But that would have required Morehouse of Dei Gratia to connive with Briggs to make it happen. While this was possible, the ship Mary Celeste did not belong to either of them. The owner was James Winchester. Also, the insurance value was quite modest. So such a planned and staged act for such a modest amount looks quite improbable.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Storm&nbsp;</b></div>
<p class="inline-ad-slot" id="inline-ad-8" style="float:left;height:0px;margin:0 auto;overflow:hidden;width:685px;" data-adtags-width="685" data-adtags-visited="true"></p><p data-adtags-visited="true">It’s true that when the crew of Dei Gratia salvaged the Mary Celeste, they found a lot of water in between the decks and about 3 and half feet water in the hold. Also, two out of the three water pumps were found to be disassembled while only one was working. This led to the theory that Mary Celeste would have been hit by a severe storm and while it was sinking, captain Briggs ordered the crew to evacuate.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify">But there are fallacies to this theory as well. There was no such storm reported in that area of Atlantic during the time the Mary Celeste was discovered abandoned. Also, the water level was not enough for a captain to order evacuation. The ship was still in sail worthy condition. However, it is possible that since Brigg’s own family was on board, he would have been extra cautious. Then why didn’t they all return and explain the story to all?</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Drunken Crew&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">It was found that 9 out of the 1701 barrels of alcohol were empty. So there was a speculation that the crew members would have consumed all the alcohol, got drunk and murdered the captain and his family due to Brigg’s tyranny over the years. Sounds good, but seems unlikely. Briggs was known as an able and well behaved captain. Also, he was never heard consuming alcohol himself and therefore likely not to have allowed crew members to consume alcohol on board.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Seaquake&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">A modern Captain David Williams offered an explanation stating that there was earthquake under the sea. As a result the nine barrels would have got dislodged and the alcohol would have leaked. So that explains the empty barrels. Heavy rumbling of the sea made the crew members panic and they jumped into a small sailing dinghy boat. Later they tried to catch up with Mary Celeste but could not, and died on the sea.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Well, this sounds interesting too. But the fact is, the crew of Dei Gratia did not report any sign of rumbling or aftershock. Also, there was no quake reported at the nearby Portuguese islands or Azores during that time.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Explosion&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Out of all the theories, a possible explosion causing Mary Celeste’s abandonment seems to be the one most likely, although it too has its own caveat. This theory was offered by James Winchester, the owner of Mary Celeste himself.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The nine barrels of alcohol which were found empty, were made of red oak and not white oak as the others. Red oaks are generally more porous. There may have been slow alcohol leakage thorough those. That would have create alcohol vapor in the hold. The barrels, that were tied with steel bands would have rubbed against each other. The friction in the steel bands then created a spark which would have then caused an explosion.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Captain Briggs seeing a violent gush of fumes and fire, would have panicked and ordered the crew to immediately get on to the life boats. In hurry, the crew could not possibly tie their boat to the ship with a strong rope. And subsequently, a strong wind would have swayed them off and all would have drowned, or died out of hunger or exposure to weather.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">However, the caveat to this theory is that when Mary Celeste was salvaged, no one could get smell of the alcohol fumes outside the hold, nor could they see any burn marks. Who knows whether the nine barrels were actually loaded empty at New York itself!</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">There is no explanation that substantiates the Mary Celeste abandonment with full evidence and facts. So this remains as one of the greatest mysteries of the ocean.</div>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p data-adtags-visited="true">Many of the researchers and authors discounted the incident of C-54 as another case of the thunderstorm accident. Yes, its true that the C54, that took off from Bermuda on July 3, 1947 met with a huge squall – a massive thunderstorm.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">And that would have surely caused the disintegration of the aircraft as reported by the investigation Board at Florida. But the real question is, why did the C54 get into the eye of the storm when it could have easily avoided it.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So let’s go through the sequence of events. C54 was a military version of the aircraft Douglas DC4 and was capable of carrying 85 passengers. On the day of the flight, there were five crew members and the experienced pilot major Ward.</div>
<div class="s4" align="center"></div>
<div class="s4"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The report from the investigation board shows that the squall was actually not at all in the originally scheduled route of the flight. Right from the start, the flight started going off course, and apparently neither the pilot nor the navigator on board were aware of this.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Soon after it took off from Bermuda, it was far south of it’s scheduled course. And then after a while, it suddenly made a course change and moved towards north and then south west. As a result, now it was heading straight towards the eye of the storm. It continued to fly in the same direction for a fairly long time till the ground radio operator heard a faint garbled SOS. The sound was so low that he ignored that to be a real SOS. Then the faint garbled sound was heard once again and then it was all silent.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="center"><b>Douglas C-54&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s0" align="center"><img src="./1_files/bermuda2_i0000d1.jpg" alt="Douglas C-54" width="371" height="224" align="middle" border="0"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The investigation board at Morrison Field, Florida went on to investigate why such odd change of course was done. They checked the credential of the navigator on board. He was a last minute substitute but a class-II navigator, which means he was qualified for the job. Major Ward was in charge. It is still unexplained how both of them could have made such a blatant mistake and had forgotten all their training to avoid a squall.</div>
<div class="s2" align="center"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Only about a month before, a general instruction was given to all the pilots to avoid thunderstorms, yet Ward flew the plane right into it and the navigator guided him to do so. About 209 miles north east of Florida, the debris were finally found. It consisted of oxygen bottle and some equipment, all of which reflected a case of a sudden destruction.</div>
<div class="s4" align="center"></div>
<div class="s4"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Here is an extract of the final report from the investigating board:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><i>“After considering all available facts and existing weather conditions, it is the opinion of the Accident Investigating Board at Morrison Field, Florida, that the aircraft encountered violent turbulence and the pilot lost control of the aircraft. It is possible that structural failure was a factor prior to contact with the ocean. No evidence of fire exists.&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><i>&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><i>There was no evidence of a ditching attempt and the debris found indicates that the crew compartment was torn apart on contact with the ocean. The last plotted position of the aircraft and the corresponding position of the frontal zone substantiates the weather assumption. Contributing factors to this accident were possible navigational error allowing aircraft to drift north of course to frontal zone and pilot error in that no apparent effort was made to circumnavigate the frontal weather.”&nbsp;</i></div>

	<div class="entry-content">
		<p data-adtags-visited="true">Flight 441 was a huge carrier that belonged to the US Navy. The civilian or the commercial model of the aircraft is known as the Super Constellation. In military version, it was called R7V-1. The aircraft was one of the greatest success of its time. It was touted that it could cross the Atlantic in 8 and half hours. On October 30, 1954, the flight 441 took off from the Patuxent River Naval Air Station bound for Lajes in Azores. There were 42 passengers, all naval officers and their families who were transported overseas.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Like in many of the Bermuda Triangle incidences, initially there were regular communication received from the aircraft. And suddenly, it was all silent. The last transmission was received around 11:30p.m which was a regular report informing its location. That time the aircraft was about 400 miles off the coast.</div>
<div class="s2" align="center">
<div class="s4" align="center"><ins class="adsbygoogle"><ins id="aswift_1_expand"><ins id="aswift_1_anchor"></ins></ins></ins></div>
</div>
<div class="s4"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">And after that, Flight 441 simply vanished. The disappearance of Flight 441 remains as one of the biggest mysteries of Bermuda Triangle. Not even a single clue till date has been gathered to throw any light on the cause. The incidence was thoroughly investigated by the board, which focussed on the plane itself, the weather and the Pilot Leonard’s capability.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The weather was somewhat typical for the North Atlantic at this time of the year – no snowing, sporadic thunderstorms and mild turbulence. But the flight 441, capable of attaining great altitudes, could have easily been above this weather. Plus the aircraft had a weather radar installed on it which was capable of giving forewarning if there was any adverse weather condition detected. The experienced pilot certainly would have avoided the bad weather based on the indications from this weather radar.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Here is what the board of investigation reported about the Pilot and the weather:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">“<i>. . .Lt. Leonard has been flying the North Atlantic routes for the past two years and it is thought that he was very familiar with this kind of weather. His choice of 17,000 feet altitude for this flight was a good one. According to the weather cross section 19,000 feet would have been an even better altitude. At any rate he should have been on top, for the most part, except for occasional buildup. It must be pointed out that the R7V-1 was equipped with ASP-42 Airborne Radar and is always used when flying this sort of weather.”&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><i>&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The Board also reported: <i>“The possibility of structural failure during transit of frontal weather cannot be discounted in this accident, but the possibility appears remote.”&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="center"><b>An R7V-1 (Similar to Flight 441)&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s0" align="center"><img src="./1_files/bermuda2_i000119.jpg" alt="R7V-1 Aircraft (Flight 441)" width="439" height="230" align="middle" border="0"></div>
<div class="s2" align="center"><i>R7V-1 was similar to the civilian model Super Constellation by &nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="center"><i>Lockheed. It was one of the most successful planes of her time&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="center"><i>and </i><i>a super performer in the commercial airline industry&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">On Pilot’s capability, the Board commented:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">“<i>Lt. Leonard was well trained in thunderstorm penetration speed and technique. It is thought that if he did enter a thunderstorm he would have entered at the correct speed and would have flown the up and down drafts without fighting them. The weather that Lt. Leonard was thought to have been subjected to was not beyond the capabilities of R7V-1, nor was it thought to be beyond his own capabilities.”&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So what could have happened to the Flight 441?</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Let’s take a look at the list of cargo carried by the aircraft: 111 life vests, 46 exposure suits, 660 paper cups and 5 life rafts. All these can easily float in water. So, if the plane blew off in the air, all these would have got scattered on the ocean water and could have been traceable. If she simply nose dived into the water without breaking off, the pilot should have sent an SOS. But none of this apparently seems to have happened.</div>

		<p data-adtags-visited="true">On December 28, 1948, the flight Douglas Dakota &nbsp;DC-3 (NC16002) took off at 10.03p.m. from San Juan airport of Puerto Rico heading for Miami (Florida). While it was only 50 miles south of Florida, it sent the last message to indicate its position. Only 20 minutes to go, the flight was never seen or heard of again.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify">It disappeared in the Bermuda Triangle area with all its 28 passengers and 3 crew <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">members.This</span> was the first instance of a DC-3 aircraft disappearing. There were subsequently two more such cases, all of them happened within 50 miles of Florida <i>Keys</i>. The <i>Keys</i> is a string of small islands just south of Florida.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Here is the full story of DC-3 / NC16002 disappearing in Bermuda Triangle.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Background of DC-3 (Douglas Dakota)&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Douglas Dakota or the DC-3 has been probably the most reliable aircraft ever designed and built. There were more than 10,000 DC-3 planes manufactured, and still hundreds remain in use. These are propeller driven aircraft and not jet planes. The economics and practical consideration have still kept them in use although small jet planes are now gradually replacing them.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">You will see lots of these aircraft in Florida and also in the whole of Caribbean and Bahamas. Their job is mainly island hopping. Because of small distances between the islands and also short runways, the big jumbo jets are usually unfit for such activities and DC-3 is ideally suited for this. The DC-3 is also widely used as private charter planes by many airlines and also for spraying pest controls from the air, particularly mosquito killers.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dreaded flight of DC-3, NC16002&nbsp;</b></div>

<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">At 7:40p.m. on 27th December 1948, the DC-3 landed at San Juan airport in Puerto Rico. It came from Miami and was scheduled to return after a short halt at San Juan.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Captain Bob Linquist reported to the ground engineers that the light indicator for the landing gear did not come on at the time of landing. The ground crew immediately started the checks and figured out that the battery was weak and running low on water. The stewardess Mary Burkes was busy deplaning the passengers and the co-pilot Ernest Hill was going around the aircraft for routine checks. The ground crew refilled the battery and informed the captain that it would take several hours for the batteries to recharge fully. The captain however decided not to wait that long and rather charge the batteries in the air from the aircraft’s own generator.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">So at 8:30p.m the DC-3 was all set to depart for Miami. By this time, Mary Burkes had on-boarded 28 passengers for the return trip.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">However, there was lot more annoying wait before the plane could finally take off. The radio transmitter in the aircraft was not working properly due to the low battery. So the aircraft was asked to wait at the end of the tarmac. The head of Puerto Rican Transport drove to the plane to talk to the captain. Linquist informed him that he could clearly receive the messages but could not every time send messages due to the low battery.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Finally at 10:03p.m. when all seemed to be okay, the flight was allowed to take off. The captain was advised to stay close to San Juan till the two way communication was fully established from the air. The flight circled the San Juan city for 11 minutes, and once the both way radio communication was confirmed, it started its journey out towards the sea for Miami.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Next, at 11:23p.m, the captain Linquist sent his routine radio transmission to indicate the flight position – it was at 8,300 feet altitude and reported ETA 4.03a.m at Miami. But funnily, while the message was received at Miami control tower which was some 700 miles away, there was no transmission received at San Juan which was much closer.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The captain next reported the flight position when it was 50 miles south of Florida and only 20 minutes to land. Strangely again, the message this time was received at New Orleans which was about 600 miles away and not Miami that was so close by. New Orleans radio tower forwarded the message to Miami station.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">And that was the last time a message was ever received from the DC-3. The weather was normal. Repeated radio signals from the control towers did not get any response. The flight DC-3 had suddenly disappeared with all its passengers and crew.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>What may have happened to DC-3&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">An explosion could have explained the aircraft getting disintegrated in the air keeping no trace of anything. No one from near or around Florida had heard any explosion. Also the waters at the Florida Keys area is so shallow that any debris could easily be seen. Even after long intensive search, there was nothing found.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Many believe that the transmitter of the aircraft was faulty and therefore the captain did not receive a message sent from Miami radio station at 12:15a.m informing that there was a change in wind direction from North West to North East. As a result, the plane could have been blown 40 to 50 miles south and off its course by the wind. Then they would have got lost, had run out of fuel and crashed. The gulf stream would have dispersed all the debris and bodies.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">This also looks improbable because when the captain last reported its position, it was 50 miles south of Florida. There was no need for the aircraft to go south of Florida to reach Miami. So the captain knew that they had been moved off course by the wind and would have used the in-flight positioning instrument to fix the position of the flight.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">One thing for sure. Whatever may have happened, would have happened suddenly and very fast. The real mystery of Douglas Dakota DC-3 in Bermuda Triangle remains unsolved till date.</div>

		<p data-adtags-visited="true">On January 30, 1948, the Star Tiger, a Tudor aircraft was on its way to Bermuda. The long 12 hours journey from Santa Maria in Azores was almost coming to an end. At 3:15 a.m., the radio operator of the aircraft received the radio position of the plane. It was all set to land at 5a.m in Bermuda. In just one and half hours time, the 25 passengers on board would see the marine lights of Bermuda. But 5a.m. had come and gone. The plane was never seen or heard of again. Here is the full story of Tudor Star Tiger’s mysterious disappearance in Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>The Background&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Star Tiger was the third Tudor Mark IV aircraft that was ordered by the British South American Airline (BSAA). It was an extended and improved Tudor aircraft manufactured by the Avro Corporation. Avro also manufactured two other types: Yorks and <span class="skimlinks-unlinked">Lancastrians.In</span> 1948, the Tudor was a relatively new aircraft and had &nbsp;history of 575 hours of flying experience from the time it was first launched. However, there was no prior incidence of accidents or malfunction.</div>

<div class="s2" align="justify"></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">On January 28, 1948, Star Tiger started from Lisbon for its first leg of journey to Santa Maria in the Azores. It was supposed to be a short halt for refueling. But due to bad weather conditions and strong winds, the Captain Brian W McMillan decided that they would fly to Bermuda the next day. So on 29th January, the flight took off from Santa Maria despite strong winds. There were 25 passengers on board, and one of them a very distinguished person – Air Marshal Sir Arthur Coningham, a hero of World War II.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The captain decided to fly at an exceptionally low altitude of 2000 feet in order to avoid the strong head wind that originates particularly due to the Gulf stream at the Atlantic. At 3:15 a.m., when many of the passengers were sleeping or dozing, the radio operator of the flight pressed a button to get position of the plane from Bermuda’s radio operator.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The Bermuda operator responded giving the position of the plane at 72 degrees. On receiving the message, the Captain McMillan and the flight radio operator agreed that the Estimated Time of Arrival at Bermuda would be 5a.m.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The Bermuda operator tried to contact the Star Tiger later at 3:50am but got no response. He tried again at 4:40am when it was almost time for the fight to start its descend for landing. He did not get any response again and immediately declared a state of emergency. The plane’s landing time of 5am had long passed. There was no trace of the flight, nor there was any distress call raised by the captain of the flight.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">There was a massive rescue operation launched by the USAAF personnel with 26 aircraft flying for 882 hours to search for the Star Tiger. The operation lasted for 5 days. But they found no trace of it or its passengers and the crew. On January 31, 1948, the news of the passenger Sir Arthur Coningham’s death shared the front page of The New York Times along with other terrible news of Mahatma Gandhi’s assassination and the death of Orville Wright.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>Investigation on the disappearance of Star Tiger&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The British Aviation Ministry immediately grounded the other two Tudor aircraft owned by the BSAA airlines although they were later released only for cargo operation. The ministry also initiated a thorough investigation headed by Lord MacMillan. The investigation lasted for 11 days.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">The team came back with a lot of observations on what could not have happened rather than what may have happened to the Star Tiger flight. Very rare to be seen in the history of such investigation, the team admitted its inability to reach to the real cause. This is what they quoted in their final report:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><i>“In closing this report it may truly be said that no more baffling problem has ever been presented for investigation. In the complete absence of any reliable evidence as to either the nature or the cause of the accident of Star Tiger the Court has not been able to do more than suggest possibilities, none of which reaches the level even of probability. Into all activities which involve the co-operation of man and machine two elements enter of a very diverse character.&nbsp;</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><i>There is an incalculable element of the human equation dependent upon imperfectly known factors; and there is the mechanical element subject to quite different laws. A breakdown may occur in either separately or in both in conjunction. Or some external cause may overwhelm both man and machine. What happened in this case will never be known and the fate of Star Tiger must remain an unsolved mystery.”</i></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify"><b>So what was the cause of Tudor Star Tiger disappearance?&nbsp;</b></div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Did the Star Tiger run out of fuel? Not possible. It was confirmed by the investigators that with its fuel tank capacity, it should have had fuel for at least one more hour of flying even after reaching Bermuda.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Was it an engine failure? The Tudor Mark IV aircraft had four engines. It is known that with the reduced load of the fuel, the aircraft could easily fly with 3 or even 2 engines. Three engines failing all at the same time is absurd.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Was it a structural failure or collapse? Even if it was a structural failure due to strong wind, the Star Tiger was flying at such a low height of 2000 feet that there should not have been any problems with the cabin pressure. So the passengers should have been all safe. There was no distress call made by the crew either. Many receiving stations were listening on Star Tiger’s frequency, and none heard anything.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Well, that leads to only one other possibility. Here is what may have happened:</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">In several communication with the Bermuda radio operators, the crew wrongly transmitted the altitude of the flight as 20,000 feet instead of 2000 feet. A Tudor aircraft typically flies at 20,000 feet. Remember, it was a long tiring flight and in such wee hours all must had been really fatigued. So, when the flight started its descend, it is possible the crew forgot they were flying at only 2,000 feet. By the time anyone realized anything, the crew simply flew the aircraft into the sea. It is quite likely that the an altimeter (measuring altitude) won’t function normally at such low heights and therefore may not have given any warnings either.</div>
<div class="s2" align="justify">Well, this is only a possibility and the real truth is still unknown.</div>
